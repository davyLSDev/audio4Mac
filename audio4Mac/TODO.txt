How to program with Cocoa APIs, ie NSError:
http://nshipster.com/nserror/
http://mono-framework.com/MonoMac  looks like some useful stuff there, lots of broken links though


this is for iOS, but seems in depth: http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/binding_objc_libs/

1. get the audio recording stuff working using native Mac ... CoreAudio or something
2. fix up the Platform detection algorithm ... make it mine
3. Bells and whistles for metering: 
	a) dB meter
	b) length of recording meter
4. fix up so this runs without crashing outside of Mac 
	... although this is test stuff, and it is designed for MacOSX tesing
5. need to look at how we do sound on WeSay
	encoding, speed, etc
	
Ideas:
	Frameworks:
		CoreAudio, (http://www.filibeto.org/unix/macos/lib/dev/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CoreAudio/CoreAudio.pdf)
			AudioQueueServices https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/AudioQueueReference/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/AudioQueueNewInput
			AudioToolkit, 
			AudioUnits
			AudioToolbox
		AVFoundation ... I understand that these were introduced in Lion
		AVAudioRecorder,
		QTKit ... I get the impression this is the old way, and it requires more coding 
		This explains in summary the main frameworks: https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html
			From what I can see, this might be what I need to explore:

Calling API from C# / C:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1285/Calling-API-functions-using-C

might learn s/th from these projects:
1) Audacity ... SVN ... slow slow slow d/l, uses WX widgets for sound
https://github.com/ringw/recorder
This looks simple & uses the AVFoundation Framework: https://github.com/magickworx/SimpleAudioRecorder
More complicated, may have ideas: https://github.com/azureatom/AudioRecorder
Using NAudio: https://github.com/tcfritchman/canyouhearmenow

	BUT, prob not supported on Mac: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6186559/will-naudio-support-mac-osx
