1. get the audio recording stuff working using native Mac ... CoreAudio or something
2. fix up the Platform detection algorithm ... make it mine
3. Bells and whistles for metering: 
	a) dB meter
	b) length of recording meter
4. fix up so this runs without crashing outside of Mac 
	... although this is test stuff, and it is designed for MacOSX tesing
